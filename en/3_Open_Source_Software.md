## Open Source Software
### Terminology
Source code is the human readable version of software.  The code is written by developers and can be read and modified by others.  The code can be compiled into an executable or binary, that is not readable.

Free software and open source software is software where the source code is distributed and can be used, copied, studied and redistributed without restrictions.

Free software is the original name put forward by Richard Stallman and defended by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  Free software is defined by [four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).  The freedom to run the program, study how it works, modify it and redistribute it.  Access to the source code is a precondition for these freedoms and not the end goal itself.

Open Source Software is the name used by the Open Source Initiative. They're the authority on certifying whether a software licence is an open source licence.  Open source software is defined in the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) by 10 criteria.

The two are almost equivalent but represent two different visions and neither want to be included in the other.  You will find authors using FOSS for "Free Open Source Software" or even FLOSS for "Free/Libre Open Source Software".  For the purposes of this whitepaper we opted to use "open source" to talk about free (in the sense of freedom) software and open source software.

### History
Free Software goes back to the beginnings of computer science. Many of the successes of Open Government could only be possible because of open source code and the generosity of internet communities. We should pay that back.

### Free Beer?
Free in English can mean something is available at no cost, or that it gives you certain freedoms. Much is available online comparing free speech, free beer & even free kittens as metaphors for free software. To avoid confusion some have expressed it as [Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS)](http://www.flora.ca/floss.shtml).

### Development
OSS is how modern organizations build software. Documented advantages over software built by a handful of developers include the quality of solutions generated through the diversity of ideas and communities that form around a shared challenge. Exposing the problem space to other interested organizations also provides additional human capital to tackle challenges. For example, Linux, an open source operating system, is the largest development project in the world, with thousands of people contributing to every release. Many competing companies contribute to Linux and other OSS, allowing them to leverage the work of a global community of OSS developers and shift developers from low-value work to high-value work.

#### Contributing to projects

### Publishing Code
See Open Source Code.

### Examples
#### US
- [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) - Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made and consider OSS solutions at every layer of the stack.
- [18F Open Source Policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md) - Use FOSS in our projects and contribute back to the open source community.
- [DoD Open Source Software FAQ](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/) - Educational resource for government employees and government contractors to understand the policies and legal issues relating to the use of OSS in the DoD.
- [DoD Memorandum on Guidance Regarding Open Source Software](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/OSSFAQ/2009OSS.pdf) - There have been misconceptions and misinterpretations of the existing laws, policies and regulations that deal with software and apply to OSS, that have hampered effective DoD use and development of OSS.

#### UK
- [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice) - Make things open by giving equal consideration to free or open source software when you choose technology - taking account of the total cost of ownership of the service, including exit and transition costs.

#### France
- [Socle interministériel des logiciels libres](http://references.modernisation.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/SILL-2016-socle-interministeriel-logiciels-libres.pdf) - L’ensemble des logiciels libres préconisés se présente sous la forme du SILL. Dans sa version actuelle, il porte sur le poste de travail, la gestion de parc, l’exploitation de serveurs, les base de données et les environnements de développement.

#### Australia
- [Australian Government Open Source Software Policy](http://www.finance.gov.au/sites/default/files/australian-government-open-source-software-policy-2013.pdf) - Procurement processes must actively and fairly consider all types of available software. Agencies will actively participate in OSS communities and contribute back where appropriate.
